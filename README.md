# Source code

1. `StatisticalAnalysis_Visualisation.ipynb `is about data visualisation and statistics. 
2. `Preprocessing.ipynb` is about preprocessing data (deleting outliers, imputation of missing values) and creating a pipeline for that.
3. `TrainingModels.ipynb` is about training different models basing on diffreent predictors. Then follows hyperparameter tuning and decision which model would be the most appropriate to use and finallu, its evaluation. The classifiers used:
    - Manual decision rules for classification 
    - DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree

# Running the scripts:

Scripts can be run from jupyter notebook as wel as in google colab. To run scripts it is be needed to install python libraries, like matplotlib etc. Working in colab might solve part of this problem, as it has already preinstalled ones.
